# Implement Index

## Cross-Slice Integration Notes

- **Foundation is committed** — `src/` directory structure, `vite.config.ts`, exact-pinned
  `package.json`, and `wrangler.jsonc` are the baseline all subsequent slices build on.
  Sibling slices must NOT introduce floating ranges (`^`/`~`/`latest`) in devDependencies.

- **No `app/` directory** — The plan described `app/router.tsx` etc.; the scaffold uses `src/`.
  All sibling slices must use `src/` paths.

- **Tailwind CSS included** — Tailwind 4.3.2 is available; design-system-shell slice can use
  it immediately without re-installation.

- **`routeTree.gen.ts` is committed** — Route generation is handled by the Vite plugin in dev mode.
  CI does NOT need a separate `generate-routes` step as long as the committed gen file stays
  in sync. Any slice that adds routes must regenerate and commit `routeTree.gen.ts`.

- **Cloudflare observability foundation** — `wrangler.jsonc` has `observability: {enabled: true}`.
  All subsequent slices' `console.log` calls in Workers code are automatically collected via Logpush.
  No additional setup needed for log collection; instrumentation signals are just `console.log(JSON.stringify({...}))`.

- **Platform proofs: API route pattern** — `createFileRoute` from `@tanstack/react-router` with
  `server: { handlers: { GET, POST } }` is the correct API for server routes in TanStack Start v1.x.
  `createAPIFileRoute` from `@tanstack/react-start/server` does NOT exist. All subsequent slices
  adding API routes must use the `createFileRoute` + `server.handlers` pattern.

- **Platform proofs: TanStack AI provider packages** — `@tanstack/ai` core is activity-based.
  Provider adapters are in separate packages: `@tanstack/ai-openrouter` (native) and
  `@tanstack/ai-openai` (OpenAI-compatible). Both exact-pinned. The `AIClient` interface in
  `src/lib/ai-client.ts` is the abstraction the ai-gateway slice extends.

- **Platform proofs: D1 binding pattern** — `wrangler.jsonc` now has `d1_databases` with
  `binding: "DB"`. The per-request `createAuth(env['DB'])` factory pattern in
  `src/lib/auth.ts` + `src/routes/api/auth/$.ts` is the architectural contract for all
  Workers routes that touch the database. No module-scope D1 client state is permitted.

- **Platform proofs: `cloudflare:workers` type shim** — `src/cloudflare-workers.d.ts` provides
  the TypeScript module declaration for `import { env } from 'cloudflare:workers'`. The typed
  `Env` interface (via `wrangler types`) is deferred to accounts-data-layer.

## Recommended Next Stage

- **Option A (default):** `/wf verify waypoint-app platform-proofs` — Vitest passes; Playwright wrangler proofs built and ready. Run `wrangler dev` to enable the SSE and D1 proof tests.
- **Option B:** `/wf review waypoint-app platform-proofs` — Skip verify if wrangler proofs are confirmed manually and evidence is captured.
